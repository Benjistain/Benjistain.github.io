    <h1> Dear Kiersten, </h1>
    
    <p> I am creating this code for many reasons, here is an ordered list (ol) of the reasons this HTML was made, in order:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li> To have an excuse to write about you, </li>
      <li> To show you more about code, </li>
      <li> To test my knowledge of HTML and CSS. </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2> Why I love you </h2>
    
    <p> Having you in my life has changed who I am for the better. You have helped me to understand how relationships can be fulfilling, meaningful, and happy, because before us, I did not understand what it meant to be dating. I love how you make me feel, and because of that, being with you is something I look forward to all the time. Being around you is the one thing that I never dread doing, and never regret doing. You are a constant positive element in my life! 
    </p>
    
    <p> Another thing I love about our relationship is sending you videos all the time... Like this one: 
    </p>

    <p> My final thing that I can do wit HTML is add an image, so I will add a nice one of you, because you are amazing and I want to see you every time i work on this page! 
    </p>

    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    
    <p> Well, that pretty well wraps up what I can do with HTML and CSS, and it also demonstrates my love to you in a pretty fun way :) I hope you liked it! I will continue to update this page as I learn.
